# Memory Corruption Attacks (1)

While I did find 1 memory corruption attack, it seems to only be useful to create an infinite loop.  I don't immediately see anyway to obtain code execution at this point.
This vulnerability stems from an incorrect that linux pathnaes are limited to 2048 characters (line 111), when in fact ext4 can have up to 4096.
